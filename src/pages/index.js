        Hello there, welcome to my personal web site. I am an application security engineer with great interest in web application vulnerabilities, secure development, and ethical penetration testing. I have recently finished my master's studies in telecommunication engineering with the cybersecurity specialty. Even though I already have a couple of years of experience in scholarships, I am looking forward to working full time in application security-related projects this September.
