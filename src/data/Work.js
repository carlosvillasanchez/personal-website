		`<p>
			I started my professional career at Accenture in the security department. I was an intern for around 6 months in a cybersecurity project for an e-commerce. My role was to help any of the 12 members that made up the team. I helped with the analysis of security tools, the creation of auditing scripts, and the management of logs from a specific tool.
		</p>
		<p>
			It gave me a great view of how a real cybersecurity project works and gave me enough knowledge, as a beginner, to start exploring the security world on my own.
